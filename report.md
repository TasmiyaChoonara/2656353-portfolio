Lab 1 report
In this lab, I learned how to create and manage a Git repository using Git and GitHub. I created branches, wrote commit messages and merged changes back into the main branch. I also learned how to structure a webpage using semantic HTML5 elements. Finally, I learned how to prepare a project for deployment using GitHub Pages.
