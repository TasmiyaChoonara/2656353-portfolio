Lab 1 Report
In this lab, I learned how to create and manage a Git repository using Git and GitHub. I practiced creating branches, writing commit messages, and merging changes back into the main branch. I also learned how to structure a webpage using semantic HTML5 elements. Finally, I learned how to prepare a project for deployment using GitHub Pages.
